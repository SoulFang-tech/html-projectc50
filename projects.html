here are some facts about camels <br>
<p class="facts">
    1.There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels. <br>
    2.Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes. <br>
    3.Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat. <br>

the second project is <a href="http://origami.me/chameleon/"> advanced origami chameleon  <img src="images/chameleon.png" width="200px" height="200px"> </a> <br>

the third project is <a href="http://origami.me/cicada/"> origami cicada <img src="images/cicada.png" width="200px" height="200px" > </a> <br>
<p class="facts">
    1. Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging. <br>
    2. The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep. <br>
    3. Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout. <br>
